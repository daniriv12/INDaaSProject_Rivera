Here is the source code for INDaaS.

=======

This folder contains:

- src contains all the relevant source code for INDaaS and collectors
- All the rest directories are supporting files for the original implementation
- Original INDaaS paper attached
- Final report of my work and analyses


-All my modifications have been done directly under src, refer to read me within for more on this.


Note:
One of the goals of my project is to determine the usability of INDaaS in a general deployment, thus the installation is not as trivial as other projects might be. Refer to main project report to better understand this.
